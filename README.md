**Hypegen** (aka. _Hype Generator_) - a landing page starter kit designed to get your ideas off the ground.

Getting a landing page up is often a great first-move for any new project.

**Hypegen apps** are simple, full-stack, open-source starting point for your business/project that use the best frameworks/libraries/tools currently available for building a mobile-first modern web application.

Setup and customization is quick and easy. Hypegen apps can be hosted on a VPS / via Docker (see instructions towards the end of this README).

Made with :heart: by [Rai Butera](https://rbutera.com) / RSTLSS.org for you & your next big idea.
